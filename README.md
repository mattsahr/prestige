# Prestige Cities

Yup.


TODO ----------------

Need some sort of reset function available in the menu.  Either one to reset everything (clear all cities, take the deck back to turn 1, and choose new bonus cards) or one to reset the turns and decks and a separate one to reset your city.

X  As part of Great Fire and Industrial Disaster modals, tell you explicitly which city to attack.



Have the modals (that can now be activated at Latest Turn on the Menu) appear proactively for every era.  They currently only appear proactively for Great Fire, Industrial Disaster, and Golden Generation.  We may conclude that closing these every turn becomes a slog for the players, but probably not, and it will definitely underscore the boardgameyness of the game.


I totally love the flavor text that you added for the eras, but of course the more you play, the more it’d be nice if there were a couple of different options for each era for what flavor text pops up so it isn’t always the same.  I will compile some more quotes, fun-facts, etc, assuming that is doable.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1XjPGyqS1sYw8siPQzqfuc8PsbMXSek_A0spb9F_R0/edit?usp=sharing

Instead of the info icon as the button you press to bring up the deck, maybe some sort of deck icon, or the word [Deck] to footstomp that the eras are coming from a virtual deck.


I need to finish up the roads stuff, improve the roads versions of the icons, and do initial playtest of the bonus cards.  I sent you some revised icons, so once those are uploaded, I’ll line up some playtesting of the related bonus cards.

Add the Beach Expansion.

Add the Mountain Expansion.

Add Blight Expansion.

Add and playtest the expansion you described early on in which you can see the edge blocks of two other cities and they affect the scoring of your edge blocks.  Codename Sister Cities?

Dice that are set aside because they were a 6 show as a 6 instead of a 3 so it is not confusing to players why they aren’t available.

Ryan suggested that in addition to clicking on the correct color block from the palette at the bottom to set which kind of block you are putting down, that you also be able to click on the dice.  If that is easy, it would be a nice touch.



X  When you "feature" a board, close the lower swipe panel
X  A summary of the "deck" and played/unplayed eras
X  Rules Page

>> A button to clear all the boards

>> Roll the dice button

>> Event-driven message --great fire, me generation, etc.

>> A note about Turn 12  -- here's the bonus, here's the cards in the next
